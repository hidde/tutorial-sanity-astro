# Example files to build your blog with Astro and Sanity

These files are used in a guide called [Build your blog with Astro and Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/guides/sanity-astro-blog). 

You'll find two applications: 

- `studio` is [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio), a Single Page Application in which you manage your content, it connects to the hosted API that has all your blog's content
- `frontend` is an [Astro](https://astro.build/)-based frontend which will generate static pages from each of the posts you've created in your studio
